<h1>How It's Made:</h1>

Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, react-router-dom, Material-UI, react-charts-js2

The Future U Dashboard was created to bring team and individual metrics to life. Workforce specialists must submit monthly Excel dashboards that show their enrollments, spending, etc. The dashboard is a way of visualizing this data in a more meaningful way. The website allows team members to view their enrollment and spending trends while seeing if they placed in the top 3 for that month. There is no current back-end attached to this application but once it is in production mode, team members will be able to add participants to their caseload and keep track of a host of other important workflow items. The charts were created using react-charts-js2 and material icons are used throughout the site. 

<h1>Optimizations:</h1>

There are many other features that I want to add to the dashboard. Some things include:
- a database that allows team members to store their caseload participants and edit their files as necessary
- finish the acount and notifications sidebar sections (currently disabled)
- add user authentication, which will allow team members to have their own account where they can edit their profile and other important settings
- include more robust and diverse graphs, that showcase other important metrics like GED completors, high school graduates, trainings completed, etc.
- once connected to the database, include React hooks that will automatically update team rankings and charts in real time

<h1>Lessons Learned:</h1>

It was fun building out this dashboard with React. I really love how simple it is to use components and link things using react-router-dom. I ran into a lot of issues with the version of Material-UI I was using and had to do a fair amount of troubleshooting to get the app live. There is so much more I want to do with this project, including turning into a full-stack web application with a server and database. I didn't get to dive into using react hooks and props like I wanted to but I am definitely going to focus on that as I start my next React project (Tea Time). I also really enjoyed using charts js and material ui. I am going to be more deliberate in incorporating tools like these into my projects moving forward.
